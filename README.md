# Coinsquare Full Stack Developer
## Technical Take Home  -  Frontend

This project was bootstrapped using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) according 
to [this fullstack React tutorial](https://www.fullstackreact.com/articles/using-create-react-app-with-a-server/)
and [this companion Redux tutorial](https://www.fullstackreact.com/30-days-of-react/day-19/).

To set up:

1. clone/download project
1. % cd /path/to/project/root
1. % npm install
1. % cd ./client
1. % npm install

To run the app:

1. % cd /path/to/project/root
1. % npm start

Note that both client and server are started from that single
command in the top-level directory. The app should launch in your default
browser at http://localhost:3000

To run the tests:

1. % cd /path/to/project/root/client
1. % npm test

Once the initial test(s) run, hit 'a' to run them all.
